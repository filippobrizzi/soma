1 - Solve the issues with the #omp parallel for : 
	(a) clauses that are attached to the paralleldirective must be forwarded to the fordirective
	(b) why dont print all the var

2 - Profiling: the loop variable must be apdated = (conditionVar - initializationVar)/increment

3 - Investigate why the condition variables in Cloth.cpp are not detected

4 - Profiling problem: when the function is like void x()
												 {

												 }
	-> solution: take the compoundstmt and insert inside
